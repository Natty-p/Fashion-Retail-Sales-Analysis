## ‚úÖ Project Overview
This project aims to analyze transactional sales data to derive meaningful insights and performance metrics (KPIs) that can guide decision-making in marketing, product strategy, and sales operations. I Used both Excel and Power BI, i transformed raw data into interactive visual dashboards and reports to uncover trends and business insights.

## üìÇ Data Source
The dataset records sales transactions over a period and includes both customer and sales rep dataset, allowing for a wide range of KPIs to be analyzed.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools Used
-  Microsoft Excel : I Used for cleaning the dataset (e.g., handling missing data, removing duplicates, formatting dates, correcting column formats).
   Performed basic transformations like calculating revenue using formulas and sorting/filtering key columns.
-  Microsoft Power BI : I Used for building dashboards and visualizations.
   KPIs such as Total Revenue, Revenue by Product Category, Revenue by Sales Rep, and Monthly Sales Trends were visualized using bar charts, line graphs, pie charts, and           slicers for filtering.

   ##  ‚ùì KPI Questions
   The project sought to answer the following key performance indicator (KPI) questions:
1. What is the total revenue over the period?
2. Which product categories and products generate the most revenue?
3. What are the top-selling products by quantity?
4. Which state or region contributes most to revenue?
5. Which sales reps are top performers in terms of revenue?
6. What is the revenue distribution across different payment methods?
7. How does revenue trend over time (monthly or quarterly)?
8. Who are the top customers in terms of revenue generated?
9. How many active vs inactive customers exist in the database?

##  üìà Findings
-	Total Revenue: The overall revenue was calculated as the sum of Product Price * Quantity across all transactions.
-	Top Product Category: Certain categories contributed more than others, indicating higher customer preference or demand.
-	Sales by Region: Some regions consistently outperformed others, possibly due to population size, income level, or sales strategy.
-	Sales Rep Performance: A small number of reps were responsible for the majority of revenue, revealing star performers.
-	Monthly Trend: Sales increased during certain months, possibly influenced by promotions or seasonal trends.
-	Payment Methods: Some methods like card payments or online banking were more popular, providing insights into customer preferences.

## üí° Recommendations
1. Focus on High-Performing Regions and Products: Invest more marketing and stock into categories and locations that yield higher sales.
2. Reward Top Sales Reps: Encourage high performance through bonuses and recognition.
3. Customer Retention: Implement loyalty programs to convert one-time buyers into repeat customers.
4. Optimize Payment Methods: Ensure popular payment methods are always available and functional.
5. Campaign Planning: Leverage seasonal peaks to plan promotions and stock adjustments in advance.

##  üöß Limitations
1.	Incomplete Customer Data: Some records lack full customer details (e.g., missing email or Active_Status), limiting deep customer analysis.
2.	No Campaign or Marketing Data: We couldn't evaluate the effectiveness of advertising or promotional campaigns.

##  üèÅ Conclusion
This project effectively used Microsoft Excel for cleaning and Power BI for interactive visualization of a transactional dataset. It identified key revenue drivers, top-performing regions and reps, and uncovered customer and sales patterns. These findings can inform strategic decisions in marketing, sales, and customer management. However, enhancing the dataset with cost, campaign, and customer feedback data would allow for deeper and more precise analysis in the future.
